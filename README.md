HE-Cal
======

This php script fetch the hackerearch event details from the their chrome extension json feed and put it into my google calendar.

You can also checkout my public HE calendar at "https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gu8k601ev6u41q9udo7fc65hb0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia/Calcutta"
	

Since Hackerearth don't provide the ending time of event in their json feed (http://www.hackerearth.com/chrome-extension/events/) we assume that the event will end after four hours. So we don't guarantee that everytime this calendar will show the right ending time of the events.

We are hosting our app at http://thawing-badlands-1730.herokuapp.com/

Feel free to report me for any bug!!!
